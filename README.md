User Management Server
This project is a basic Express.js server implementation designed to help beginners understand the fundamentals of server-side programming. It focuses on how servers work, how data is handled, and how to integrate servers with a local or external client application.

Features
Basic Express Server: A lightweight and modular framework for creating server-side applications.
CORS Integration: Enables cross-origin requests between the server and clients running on different domains or ports.
API Routes:
GET /: Returns a welcome message from the server.
GET /users: Fetches a list of predefined users.
POST /users: Allows adding a new user to the list.
Middleware Usage:
express.json() for parsing JSON request bodies.
cors() for handling cross-origin resource sharing.
In-Memory Data: The project uses an array to manage user data instead of a database, simplifying the learning process.
Project Goals
The goal of this project is to:

Understand how a server operates locally.
Learn how to set up RESTful APIs using Express.js.
Explore how to handle client-server communication.
Get familiar with middleware and request-response cycles in Express.js.
Technologies Used
Node.js: JavaScript runtime environment for server-side applications.
Express.js: Web framework for creating robust APIs.
CORS: Middleware to handle cross-origin resource sharing.
How to Run the Project Locally
Clone the Repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/user-management-server.git
cd user-management-server
Install Dependencies: Make sure you have Node.js installed on your machine, then run:

bash
Copy code
npm install
Start the Server:

bash
Copy code
node index.js
The server will run on the default port 5000 (or as set in process.env.PORT).

Test the Endpoints: Use a tool like Postman or cURL to interact with the following endpoints:

GET http://localhost:5000/
GET http://localhost:5000/users
POST http://localhost:5000/users with a JSON body:
json
Copy code
{
  "name": "Your Name",
  "email": "your-email@example.com"
}
API Routes
GET /:

Description: Returns a welcome message from the server.
Response Example:
text
Copy code
User management server
GET /users:

Description: Fetches all users.
Response Example:
json
Copy code
[
  { "id": 1, "name": "Tusher", "email": "tu@gmail.com" },
  { "id": 2, "name": "Bhakta", "email": "bhak@gmail.com" },
  { "id": 3, "name": "Anta", "email": "nt@gmail.com" }
]
POST /users:

Description: Adds a new user to the in-memory data array.
Request Body Example:
json
Copy code
{
  "name": "New User",
  "email": "newuser@example.com"
}
Response Example:
json
Copy code
{ "id": 4, "name": "New User", "email": "newuser@example.com" }

Future Improvements
Add a database (e.g., MongoDB or MySQL) to manage persistent user data.
Implement user authentication and authorization.
Build a front-end client to consume the APIs.
Enhance error handling for invalid or malformed requests.
Conclusion
This project demonstrates the basic setup and functionality of an Express.js server. It’s a great starting point for understanding server-side programming and building more complex applications. Contributions and feedback are welcome!
